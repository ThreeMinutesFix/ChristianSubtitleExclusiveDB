about us

it's simply that if the lord regent

always said he trusted him

oh no trumpkins no traitor but over the

years many of our champions have set out

to look for the lost prince

436

and not one has ever come back so the

437
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
king has decreed

438
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,520
not to have all his bravest narnians

439
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
destroyed in the search for his lost son

440
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
so now nobody is allowed to go but

441
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
surely he'd let me go

442
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
once he knew who i was and who sent you

450

aslan has been seen in the islands

457

the prince is still alive but that

551

almost makes it worse

for it means the evil woman must have

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,840
some use for him

expect i'll ever see the king back in

681
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
narnia now that he set off for foreign

682
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,839
parts

683
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,760
and he had a nasty cough when he left

684
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
and trumpkins old

685
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,839
and failing fast and we'll have a bad

686
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,599
harvest after this drought

687
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,640
dry summer and i shouldn't wonder if

688
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
some enemy attacked the country so all

689
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,720
in all

690
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,280
you may as well come with us but where

691
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,480
should we start

692
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
we've got to start by finding the ruined

693
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
city of the giants

694
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,440
aslan said so got to start by finding it

695
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,079
have we

696
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,560
yes aren't we allowed to start by

697
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,680
looking for it

698
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,839
that's what i meant of course and then

699
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,280
when we found it we can

700
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,880
oh yes isn't the stew ready yet

701
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,839
ready it might be

702
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,040
thank you

703
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:03,280
but you're not going to like it

704
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,319
delicious it's the best you i've ever

705
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,599
tasted in my life

706
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,960
might taste all right but beware of

707
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
collywobbles in the tummy

708
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,480
food for wiggles is poison

709
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,440
for humans

710
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,960
where were we doesn't anybody know where

711
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,160
the worm city is

712
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,319
i don't know about anybody but if i were

713
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,839
looking for the ruined city i wouldn't

714
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,720
start from here

715
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,599
where would you start from it is more

716
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,200
but can't we get to weddings more from

717
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,599
here

718
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,000
yes of course see those hills and that

719
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
bit of a cliff over there where the

720
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
dragons flying bound to meet some of

721
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,079
those brutes

722
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,920
well those hills are the beginnings of

723
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,839
ettinsburg but

724
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,800
there's a river between it and us no

725
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,480
bridges of course

726
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
perhaps on ettin's more we shall meet

727
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,520
people who can tell us the way

728
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,480
me people oh yes you're right about that

729
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,920
what sort of people live there

730
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,560
oh i suppose they're all right in their

731
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,839
own way

732
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,960
yes what kind of people live there kind

733
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,640
is one thing they're not you'll see now

734
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
look here

735
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,079
i don't believe the whole thing could be

736
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,240
half as bad as you're making out

737
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,560
just as the beds in the wigwam were hard

738
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,040
well the firewood was wet

739
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
i don't think islam would ever have sent

740
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,319
us here if there was as little chances

741
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,319
all that that's it boy

742
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,560
put a brave face on it all we have to

743
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,400
worry about is our tempers

744
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
and all our hard times are going to have

745
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,079
to go through together we'll do to lose

746
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,200
our tempers you know

747
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,960
otherwise we'll finish up knifing each

748
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,599
other

749
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,440
i shouldn't wonder well if you think

750
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,760
it's as useless as all that

751
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,520
you can stay behind paul and i will go

752
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,000
alone don't be such an idiot scrub

753
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,920
no no i'm coming sure i'm certain

754
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,359
i'm not going to lose an opportunity

755
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,160
like this it'll do me good

756
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,640
you see

757
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,960
the other marsh wiggles think i'm too

758
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,920

759
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,720
flighty i don't take life seriously

760
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,520
enough

761
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,640
they think i'm too full of bobbins

762
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,079
and bounce life's not all eel pie and

763
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,599
fricassee frogs they say

764

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,599
looking for a prince

767
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,319
who probably won't be there by way of a

768
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,800
ruined city that nobody's ever seen

769
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,440
just a thing if that doesn't steady a

770
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,160
chap

771
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,680

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,240
harm

776
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,000
but because i've had enough already and

777
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920

but they were badly beaten in several

savage battles and now they have to pay

tribute

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,720

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,599
lifted up the visor of that helmet and

1018
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:48,720
looked inside

1019
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,720
i'll hang it all what else could be

1020
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,319
inside except a man

1021
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,599
a skeleton or maybe nothing at all or

1022
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,119
nothing you could see

1023
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,520
invisible huddle glam you do have the

1024
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,200
most horrible ideas

1025
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,680
you're always expecting the worst and

1026
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,440
you're always wrong

1027
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,599
let's think about those gentle giants

1028
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,520
get as quickly as we can to half hour

1029
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,760
i don't think we should go to and not

1030
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,200
safe oh really

1031
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,040
besides i don't know what a gentle giant

1032
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,880
is and aslan signs made no mention of

1033
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
staying with giants gentle or otherwise

1034
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,400
now look here

1035
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,119

1036
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,280
sleeping on cold hard earth

1037
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,040
we want to enjoy a bit of warmth and

1038
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,480
comfort

1039
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,839

1040
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,280

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,160

trim tazzan came and was terribly angry

01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
with me because i hadn't remembered the

1277

signs

1278
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,718
look look they were the words

1279
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,840
under me under me

1280
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:49,840
what can that mean under me

1281
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,040
ruined city under me

1282
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,080
the second and third signs muffed

1283
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,120
that's the rune city all right we must

1284
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,000
have walked right over

1285
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,440
it in the snowstorm it's my fault

1286
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,159
i've given up repeating the signs i've

1287
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,360
been thinking about them i could have

1288
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,719
seen it was a sitting

1289
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,840
even in all that snow i'm worse i did

1290
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,239
see

1291
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,719
or partly i had a feeling we ought to

1292
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,080
stop

1293
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,880
the truth is you were so keen on getting

1294
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,320
to this place

1295
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
ever since we met that woman with black

1296
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,520
knight

1297
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,560
nearly forgotten about prince william

1298
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,920
i shouldn't wonder if that isn't exactly

1299
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,480
what she

1300
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,520
intended what i don't understand is how

1301
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,199
could we miss anything as big and clear

1302
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,760
as those letters

1303
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,360
we didn't you fell into it

1304
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,480
into the e of me that was the trench

1305
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,960
with its three side passages

1306
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,560
it's clear that the green lady

1307
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,040
making you think of hot food and hot

1308
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,400
water

1309
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,719
was to make you forget about everything

1310
01:17:58,719 --> 01:17:59,760
else

1311
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,239
aslan was right to be angry with me i

1312
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,640
should have remembered the signs

1313
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,920
what are they what are they

1314
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,360
hang on you told them to me

1315
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,040
i ought to be able to remember them

1316
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,560
first journey north

1317
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,239
well we've done that

1318
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,640
it's my fault it's all my fault

1319
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,400
to journey north until you come

1320
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,080
to the ruined city of the ancient giants

1321
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,679
three when you find writing on a stone

1322
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,719
do what the writing tells you to do oh

1323
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,400
but

1324
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,320
he always goes just when i want him to

1325
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,080
explain

1326
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,280
well the writing says under me

1327
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,600
it doesn't make much sense yes it does

1328
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,840
though

1329
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,920
it means that we've got to look for

1330
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,120
prince william

1331
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:13,199
under that ruined city but how

1332
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,280
that's another question well we should

1333
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,840
just have to go back i suppose

1334
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,760
if we can see the word city from here it

1335
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,960
can't be far

1336
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,159
no point in hanging around for the

1337
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:26,080
blessed autumn feast let's go now

1338
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,480
haven't you had any breakfast oh yes

1339
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,839

1341

manage it

1342
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,159
anyway do you think the giants really

1343
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,760
meant to make a separatist

1344
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,280
well whether they did or not that's what

1345
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,960
we are

1346
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,040
we'll never get out of here i shouldn't

1347
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,040
wonder

1348
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,360
except we don't know if we are there

1349
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,960

he came close to me

suppose suppose we have only

dreamed and made up these things like

that the made up things are a good deal

2199
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:58,398
better than the real ones

and if this black pit of a kingdom

is the best you can make then it's a
