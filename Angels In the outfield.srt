00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,505

GEORGE: I want you here,
in uniform, at 9:00 tomorrow!

149
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,503
We're going back to work
on fundamentals!

150
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:59,501
-Fundamentals? In the middle of the season?
-I thought the game started at 1:00.

151
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:04,501
It does started 1:00!
And you a jackass!

152
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,500
- No, I'm a pitcher.

You have to start trade them.

159
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,505
All of them, now!

160

HANK: I can't trade 25 players.

161
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:32,504
No, no, no! I can't win with
these guys. And nobody can.

162
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,506
There's a thing called talent.

- They don't have it.
- This isn't Cincinnati, George.

No one expects you
to win big with these boys.

170
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,505

assistant for media relations.

172
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:05,504
You're scheduled to do Ranch
Wilder's postgame show here...

173
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,507
- And he's been waiting.
- Oh, the press are all scum.

174
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,508
They're meant to be kept waiting.

175
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:10,506
- And Ranch Wilder's worse than scum.
- RANCH: Whose fault is that?

176
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:11,508
That is not my fault.

177
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,504
What ever happened to Barney or
Bailey, or whatever?

178
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,504
You fired him, and they
hired me on Monday.

179
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,505
Then I can't officially
fire you until Friday.

180
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,500
Make a note.

181
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:26,500
GEORGE: Oh, what a waste.
Uh, where, where, where?

182
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:27,504
- Right here.
- All right, all right.

RANCH: And we're back with
Angels manager George Knox.

188
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,507
- This was a tough loss today.
- Any loss is hard.

189
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,501
But this one really got to you.

190
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:47,509
You leave Cincinnati after
ten years of winning ball clubs.

191
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,505
although the really big one always
seemed to be just out of reach--

192
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,505
and you come out here
to manage our Angels.

193
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,503
Now, expectations were high that
you could turn this team around...

194
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,503
but that just doesn't
seem to be happening.

195
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,503
- Season's only half over, Ranch.
- And your club's in last place.

196
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:05,509
You oughta know how one incident
can change the course of events.

197
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:08,503
Well, you know, you play
the game, you take your chances.

198
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,506
Sometimes you're just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

199
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:13,505
- Yeah, you're an expert at that.
- I could say the same about you.

200
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:15,506
- Well, actions speak louder than words.

the baseball game tomorrow.

209
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:39,507

and you have an interview.

She'll be here at 11:00.

211
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:46,509
Good. I don't want to go to
the game anyway. Angels never win.

212
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,509
- (SCOFFS)
- I wanna go to the game.

213
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:51,505
They could win. It could happen.

214

Yeah, and you could drop dead
after dinner with food poisoning.

- It's not really Jell-O.

And you know I would never use
food colouring on my cat brains.

Been to the bathroom?

- JP: Good night, Maggie.

- I didn't wash my face.

over and tuck in sheets.

She's got a lot to do.

Okay, we have three
photo ops. It'll be quick.

453
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,508
Give 'em publicity stills.
It'll be quicker.

They want a picture with you.
They're all kids.

Uh, would either of you mind smiling?
The team did just win.

461
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,503
It was a mistake.
This team can't win.

462
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,506
They won. Cause there
were angels out there.

Real ones. I saw 'em.

Two angels came out of the sky
and they picked up Ben Williams.

466
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:11,501
And another angel hit Messmer's
home run. That's why the bat broke.

467

Great, a psycho kid. David,
you'd think they'd screen these people.

468
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:21,504
It's true! Ask Williams
about it. Or Messmer.

They'll tell you something's
goin' on. You'll see.

in life that just can't be explained.

Uh--

the possibility of miraculous
things happening.

Nice catch yesterday, Ben.

so fast you don't even remember?

somebody had me by the arms, Skip.

How'd I do that?

a regular homer. you know?

It felt like someone was swingin'
with me. Very strange.

I could feel some added power
comin' from somewhere.

It must've been those chilli dogs
I ate before the game.

Roger won a photograph

give it to him myself.

No, no.
We're not related.

00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:32,507
- You saw an angel?
- Yeah. In my Coke cup.

607
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,505
- In your Coke cup?
- Yeah.

608
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:39,505
Okay.

609
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,503
I gotta get back to the dugout.

610
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:45,501
What should I do
if I see another one?

611
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:50,500
Kid, I was thinking of you
as a sort of good luck charm...

612
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:52,508
not as someone
who spiritually hallucinates.

613
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,502
What's that?

614
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,505
It means if you see anything
weird, keep it to yourself.

615
00:36:58,509 --> 00:36:59,509
But wait! You should know.

616
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,504
You're the manager,
and the angels are here to help...

617
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,502
and if I don't tell you,
you're not gonna know--

618
00:37:04,502 --> 00:37:05,502
Calm down.

619
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,509
In baseball, we got signals.

620
00:37:09,502 --> 00:37:10,507
Make some kind of signal.

621
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:13,507
Okay? I can't come over here
every couple of seconds.

622
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:15,507
Um, I'll go like that, okay?

623
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:20,503
Oh, okay. You do that.
That's fine. Okay.

624
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:21,509
And we--
And we can't let David know.

625
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:24,505
Yeah, right. Absolutely.

626
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:28,509
We can't tell David.
Can't tell anyone.

627
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,505
Thank you.

628
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500

- Yeah.

629

Here's the pitch.

638
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,502
And it's lined to left...

639
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:13,905
for another base hit.

640
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,506
- Shit! Damn!
- So it's more bad news...

641
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:17,507
- Shit!
- for manager Knox...

- GEORGE: Strike?

645

Aw, come on, now!
That's no strike!

- I want your hats off.

00:38:47,503 --> 00:38:49,503
- Yeah?
- It's nacho butt.

651
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:52,507
Go buy the kids nachos.

652
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:56,504
Anything but nachos.

653
00:38:56,506 --> 00:39:00,504
- Buy them Angels jackets.
- It's 90 degrees outside.

Get your butt up there, now!

- (SIGHS)
- You know, uh,

656

it's been four innings,
and no real angels yet.

657
00:39:11,502 --> 00:39:14,503
And, you know, I was just thinking,
maybe you shouldn't swear so much.

658
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:15,509
I bet the angels don't like it.

659

- Huh?
- I mean it! No swearin'!

664
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,503
That eliminates all speech
for most of the team.

665

RANCH: So here in the ninth,

666
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,506
the Athletics have opted
to bring in reliever...

667

Tom Ruddy to pitch
to Angels heavy hitter

Ray Mitchell.

- Oh-ho, wow!
- What happened?

670
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:10,504
There's an angel
right next to Hemmerling.

671
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,508
Uh, David, I-I need a drink.

672

- You have drinks.
- I don't want these.

- I want something else.
- What else?

674
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,507
Uh, coffee.

675
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:22,509
You drink coffee?

676
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,505
- Yeah. Of course. All the time.
- Yeah, all the time.

What do you think we are,
little kids or something?

What's goin' on?

684
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:02,500
- There's an angel with Hemmerling.
- What?

685
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,504
There's an angel massaging
Hemmerling's shoulders.

(SIGHS)

This is ridiculous. I don't know
what you see,

but there's no one
with Hemmerling.

his shoulders.

- Huh?
- A-A-And what should I do about it?

691
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:28,509
Put him in.
Pinch-hit.

692
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:32,501
I-I got Mitchell coming up.
He's my best hitter.

693
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:34,508
Hemmerling can't hit
the broad side of a barn.

694
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:39,500
I can't substitute my worst hitter
for my best hitter.

695
00:41:39,503 --> 00:41:41,501
If you want a hit,
you'll put in Hemmerling.

696
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:42,508
It's crazy! Wacko.

697
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:46,506
- You forget about it. Ah!
- But he's got an angel.

Wait a minute. What's the worst thing
that could happen?

699
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:54,506
Are we gonna fall
out of last place? Heh.

700
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:06,500
Sit down, Mitchell.
You're up, Hemmerling.

You're out and you're in.

And he's bringing in Danny Hemmerling,
the utility infielder...

who is known, sports fans, for his
glove, but definitely not for his bat.

00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,500
- Hey, you got job security.
- Job security?

761
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:24,505
- (SHUTS DOOR)
- Who knew?

762
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:27,505
So, you're right.
Hemmerling came through.

763
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:29,508
- Yeah, 'cause of the angel.
- Aw, whatever.

764
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:33,501
- No, we got angels helping the team.
- Ah, well, that may be,

765
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,504
but we're winning.

766
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:35,507
Yeah.

767
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,504
All the games, man!
Can you believe it?

768
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:41,505
GEORGE: When we're on the road,
you should watch the games on TV.

769
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,500
We'll figure out a way
for us to talk on the phone.

770
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:46,509
You mean, the phone in the dugout
you're always yelling into...

771
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,509
and-and banging against
the wall and spitting at?

772
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:50,504
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that phone.

773
00:45:50,504 --> 00:45:52,506
Cool! (LAUGHS)

774
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:57,508
What a game. First time Hemmerling
got a hit, let alone a home run.

775
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,509
It's 'cause of the angels.
They helped him.

776
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,507
Get in.

777
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:04,501
Come on.
We don't have all day.

778
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:09,500
- J.P. doesn't ride in cars.
- What's the problem? He gets carsick?

779
00:46:09,504 --> 00:46:10,506
ROGER: Sort of.

780
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:12,503
He used to live
in a car with his mom.

781
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,507
He slept in the front seat
all curled up like a cat or something.

782
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:18,503
When he gets in a car,
his stomachache comes back.

783
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,503
(BUS HONKS)

(OPENS DOOR)

785
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:40,509
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- All right.

786
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:45,501
- Thank you for the ride home.
- He speaks?

(CLOSES DOOR)

788
00:46:48,507 --> 00:46:50,507
- Hi. You guys have a good time?
- Hi.

789
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:52,507
- A blast!
- We won!

790
00:46:52,507 --> 00:46:55,500
- Great.
- Where's Miguel?

791
00:46:55,504 --> 00:46:56,508
I got him all sorts of stuff.

792
00:46:57,509 --> 00:47:00,506
Miguel got placed in a foster home
this afternoon.

793
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:04,505
- He got placed?
- Miguel's gone?

794
00:47:04,506 --> 00:47:05,506
Mmm-hmm.

795
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,503
Where? With who?

796
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,501
A real nice family
from Northridge.

797
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:14,509
I'm gonna miss him.
I really liked Miguel!

798
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:19,509
I only have a licence
for short-term care.

799
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,507
You know? M-Miguel's been here
for, what, six months?

800
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,509
- I think seven.
- Seven months. Right.

801
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:30,500
That's what happens, you know?
I mean, you understand that, Roger.

802
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:32,503
Oh, don't feel bad, Maggie.

803
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,507
I bet we see him again.
Maybe in court or something.

804
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,502
Oh, Roger.

805
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,501
God forbid.

806
00:47:45,508 --> 00:47:48,507
- JP: Roger?
- ROGER: What?

807
00:47:50,508 --> 00:47:52,502
Are you asleep?

808
00:47:53,505 --> 00:47:55,506
If I was asleep,
how'd I be talkin' to you?

809
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,507
You could be "sleeptalking."

810

(SIGHS) Look, I'll give you a dime tomorrow
ifyou don't say another word.

Okay.

JP: Roger?

813

(SIGHS)
You can forget that dime.

814
00:48:18,507 --> 00:48:21,506
Do you think your parents
are gonna ever come get you?

815
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,502
I don't know. Mom's not alive,
but my dad's gonna come get me.

816
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:30,507
ROGER: I'm sure of it.

817
00:48:31,505 --> 00:48:34,500
You think my mom's
gonna ever come get me?

818
00:48:35,502 --> 00:48:37,500
Maybe, you know.

819
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,508
It could happen.

820
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:43,507
Yeah, it could happen.

821
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:50,508
- JP: Roger?
- What?

822
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:53,507
I'm happy you see the angels.

823
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,503
Me too.

00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,500
JP: Good night.

825
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:10,504
RANCH: It's a beautiful day
here in Anaheim...

826
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:13,505
as the resurgent Angels
prepare to meet their longtime

827
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:15,504
nemesis, the Detroit Tigers...

828
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:18,507
who have won the first five games
of their Western road trip.

829
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,500
WALLY: They've been the hottest team in the
league for the last few weeks, Ranch.

830
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,503
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder:
the most popular--

831
00:49:26,503 --> 00:49:28,508
...coming up next week
with Cap Night...

832
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:33,505
this year featuring a totally white cap
with red pinstripes and the Angel logo.

833
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,507
It's free for the first 50, 000 fans
entering Anaheim Stadium.

834
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:50,503
- I see an angel.
- Already?

835
00:49:52,502 --> 00:49:56,507
I gotta go bathroom. I can't go alone.
Bad guys might get me.

836
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:59,502
We just came back
from the bathroom.

837
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:01,504
- Gotta go now. Sorry.
- Gimme your Coke.

838
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,501
Gimme the Cracker Jacks.
Stand up.

839
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:07,501
DAVID: Go.

840
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,504
- What's-- What's up?
- We got an angel.

841
00:50:21,502 --> 00:50:22,509
But the game hasn't started.

842
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:24,509
She was with Mel Clark.

843
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:37,508
Aah! Impossible.

844
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,500
She was there. That means Mel
should start the game today.

845
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,509
- Mel's arm is gone.
- I don't care. He should start the game.

846
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:46,509
Uh-uh. No way! And besides,
he's not even on the active roster.

847
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,509
If the angel pitches with him,
he'll be awesome.

848
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,509
You really do see something,
don't you?

849
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:09,504
Yeah, I do.

850
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,504
Good. All right.

851
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:49,500
You're off injured reserve
and you're starting today.

852
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:53,507
- You talkin' to me?
- Yeah.

853
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:56,504
So get your stuff together.

854
00:52:02,504 --> 00:52:05,505
RANCH: Starting pitcher announced
for this game was Dan Prince...

855
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:08,507
but just moments ago,
the Angels made a dramatic change...

856
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:11,508
and activated the
long-injured Mel Clark.

857
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,508
League rules specify that up
until the first pitch is thrown,

858
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:16,502
the roster can be altered...

859
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:20,501
although I can't ever remember
this happening so near game time.

860
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:24,503
- Me neither, Ranch.
- Easy, Wally. Less is more.

861
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:28,504
These warm-ups
should be interesting.

862
00:52:30,502 --> 00:52:32,500
Over the plate, Mel!

863
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:34,504
- WALLY: Clark looks a little rusty.
- MEL: Unh!

864
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:37,507
RANCH: Too much time
in the whirlpool, Wally.

865
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:44,502
I'm checking to see if Dan Prince
pulled a muscle during his warm-up.

866
00:52:44,507 --> 00:52:48,508
There must be some logical explanation
as to why George Knox...

867
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:50,507
would make such a bizarre change.

868
00:52:50,507 --> 00:52:53,507
I have personally checked
the stats, sports fans...

869
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:57,501
and Mel Clark hasn't started a game...

870
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,502
In this decade.

871
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:02,505
WALLY: He looks mighty
 nervous out there.

872
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:06,501
RANCH: Not as nervous
as George Knox.

873
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:26,500
RANCH: Clark takes the sign.

874
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:32,509
Talk about heat!

875
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,509
- Messmer felt that one.
- Ow!

876
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:36,509
Wow!

877
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,502
What an amazing pitch!

878
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,505
You damn-- darn right.

to memory, Wally...</i>

<i>'cause he doesn't have
any more of those in him.</i>

881

It's now the top of the ninth. There
are two outs. We've got a full count.

chance to get back...</i>

(PLAYERS CHEERING EXCITEDLY)

901
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,505
- All right, Mel!
- Yeah! Yeah!

902
00:54:48,503 --> 00:54:49,505
It's unbelievable.

903
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:53,500
How in the world did
old noodle-arm pull that off?

904
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,508
And who gets the credit?

905
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,501
George Knox. George Knox.

906
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:04,500
And we're down in the Angels' clubhouse
for a talk with manager George Knox.

907
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,500
- What inspired you to start Mel?
- A feeling.

908
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,504
An instinct. A kind of faith.

909
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:12,503
A faith in what? Has Mel shown
this kind of power in practice?

910
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,501
Mel Clark has always shown himself
to be an extraordinary athlete.

911
00:55:16,508 --> 00:55:19,504
The rest is about believing
in something or someone.

912
00:55:19,504 --> 00:55:21,504
And when did you suddenly start
believing in Clark?

913
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:23,501
He's been sitting on
the bench all season.

914
