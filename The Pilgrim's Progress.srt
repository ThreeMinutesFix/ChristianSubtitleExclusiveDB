Many years ago, in
the realm of Apollyon,

3
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,444
past the garden
of four rivers,

4
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:37,197
and in the region of Abaddan,

5
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:41,201
there stood an old city.

6
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:45,455
Its name in the ancient
tongue was Noit Curtsed.

But time and speech
and a brilliant mind

8

of Not Cursed.

Though some would have
thought it wishful thinking,

for the city was indeed
cursed with perpetual decay,
