1
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:10,920
That area's off limits.

2
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,292
It's got to be a Russian sub.

3
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,083
The readings aren't typical
of their nuclear vessels, sir.

4
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,125
Something weird is going on.

5
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,792
Hmm.

6
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,958
Try to make contact!
They might be in trouble.

7
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:31,667
Intruder aboard. Dead ahead. Inside.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
Open the hatch.

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,958
What's that? A woman?

10
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,042
Get them up, honey.

11
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,875
Nighty-night.

12
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,542
One year from now,

13
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:00,375
you will become an army of living dead

14
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,500
to serve The Mandarin.

15
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:11,375
Hasta la vista, Boris.
Sorry to hypnotize and run.

16
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,708
I'm out of here.

17
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,375
Stop fighting it, Tony.
Come on, work into the pain.

18
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,583
Push, Tony! Harder!

19
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:33,875
Boy, is that all you've got?

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,542
Didn't anyone ever tell
you you're hard to resist?

21
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,792
Never try to snow
your physical therapist.

22
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,792
Now, good, lean on me,
point your toes and kick like crazy!

23
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,542
Come on, Tony, faster!

24
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,083
Whoa, man!

25
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:52,000
My job description didn't say anything
about getting spritzed by the boss.

26
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,208
March 11th, 3:00 P.M.
Hyper Tech seminar, remember?

27
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:58,458
I should give you a raise

28
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,250
for getting me out of
this torture chamber, Jim.

29
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,958
What is that?

30
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,583
It's a Code Ten alarm!

31
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,833
Hang on!

32
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,958
Come to papa.

33
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:42,333
Your hand, Whirlwind! Up, Knightwing!

34
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,708
Whirlwind and Dreadknight!

35
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,625
Veronica!

36
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,875
All right,
but she could have been killed.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,000
They tried to break into the Armory
but they tripped all the alarms.

38
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,250
A direct assault on the
Armory in broad daylight?

39
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,500
That isn't The Mandarin's usual style.

40
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,920
Secure the area and clean up. We
don't want this leaking to the press.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm on it.

42
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,000
Double Armory security.

43
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,792
If The Mandarin gets the
secret for my armor for his army,

44
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,208
no one will be able to stop him.

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,250
They come!

46
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,667
Quickly.

47
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,500
They'll
never miss one microchip

48
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,500
when so many were
destroyed in the fire.

49
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,542
Yes.

50
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:39,250
This enables me to synchronize

51
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,000
with the device Hypnotia
planted on the submarine.

52
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,208
The fools think your
raid was a failure,

53
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,417
but in exactly one year,

54
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,250
I shall have the means
to destroy Iron Man.

55
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:59,333
That's a long time to
wait for vengeance, Mandarin.

56
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:05,000
I'd wait for eternity to
crush the only one who stands

57
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:09,708
between me and world domination!

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,962
It's been nearly a
year since The Mandarin bombed out

59
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,083
trying to get in here.
Think he's lost interest?

60
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:24,125
No way. It's not like him
to give up after one attempt.

61
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,667
Admiral Harold Younger, Tone.
He's got a job for Stark Enterprises.

62
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,750
Mr. Stark. The White House
wants you in on Operation Prometheus.

63
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,625
On March 11 last year,

64
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,208
the Prometheus, a Russian nuclear sub,

65
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,333
vanished off the coast of Norway.

66
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:41,917
Our task force just pinpointed
an area off the coast of Scotland

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,292
where we think the tides took her.

68
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,417
Mr. Stark, whatever is in that sub

69
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,792
may have the power
to destroy life on Earth.

70
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,167
A crewman on a British
frigate was taping his shipmates

71
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,917
just as this tanker passed
somewhere over the Prometheus.

72
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:08,458
It's as you feared. They know.

73
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,500
I fear nothing, Hypnotia,

74
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,417
but Tony Stark shall
not ruin our master plan.

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I must inform The Mandarin at once.

76
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:22,625
What about my ride,
you horrible little troll?

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,875
You did
well to inform me, Modok.

78
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,458
Almost time.

79
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:39,417
Now nothing will interfere
with our rendezvous with destiny!

80
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,333
Tell that to Iron Man!

81
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:45,250
Tony Stark is sure
to send him to investigate.

82
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,583
Then we must be sure he has company.

83
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,667
Dreadknight! Blacklash!

84
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,625
Grey Gargoyle! Whirlwind!

85
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,792
Blizzard!

86
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,875
I have a mission for you. But first,

87
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,792
come forward, Blizzard.

88
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,167
What's the problem? I've been loyal!

89
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,167
Loyal, yes.

90
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,917
Intelligent, no!

91
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,000
When you carelessly created
a Fast Freeze to cool your drink,

92
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,625
you killed my begonias!

93
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,208
Unforgivable!

94
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:49,708
But I shall spare you,
because I am merciful.

95
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:58,125
Now go to the garden
and start fertilizing!

96
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,833
As you command.

97
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,208
On to the submarine Prometheus!

98
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:13,042
You shall provide a suitable
welcome for our iron-domed friend!

99
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,667
Nothing can stop The Mandarin!

100
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,375
The Prometheus vanished March 11,

101
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,750
the same day The
Mandarin hit the Armory.

102
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,042
You need to change to Undersea
Armor when you get there.

103
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,750
Now how are you gonna
handle that alone?

104
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,083
I won't be alone.
Meet IRVING!

105
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,708
Irving? Irving who?

106
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,083
My new invention. IRVING stands for

107
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:38,917
In-flight Refit Vehicle with Interactive
Neuromimetic Gear. I-R-V-I-N-G.

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,125
Powering up!

109
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,833
I still don't like it, Tone.

110
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:43,833
Thrusters on. Lift-off!

111
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,250
Onboard navigation
locked on destination,

112
00:09:57,333 --> 00:10:00,125
and I'm avoiding civilian
and military air corridors.

113
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,083
Activating video.

114
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,083
You're
coming in loud and clear.

115
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,583
Piece of cake, Jimbo.

116
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,458
This is Reginald Dimpton at the
British end of the new Hammer Tunnel

117
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,333
which will link England to Belgium.

118
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,542
And now, the man who built
this engineering marvel...

119
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,625
Where's Iron Man?

120
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,958
Put Iron Man back on!

121
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,583
- Who's messing with the remote?
- Where is he?

122
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,958
Take it easy.
I was just looking for a ball game.

123
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,958
...Justin Hammer.

124
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,667
Thank you, Reg.

125
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,917
I'll cut the ribbon,
officially opening my tunnel,

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,167
when Big Ben strikes high noon.

127
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,333
We now return you to
our regular programming.

128
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,625
What's the story, I.M.?

129
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,292
I'm off the Scottish coast.

130
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,458
Readings indicate the Prometheus
is 81.3 fathoms below target scan.

131
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,458
Changing to Undersea Armor.

132
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,292
Now, IRVING.

133
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,250
Now let's find Prometheus!

134
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,208
After you, IRVING.

135
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,833
Coordinates established. Looks
like IRVING's picked up the scent.

136
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,583
I'm getting unusually strong energy
readings, but they aren't nuclear.

137
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,792
In fact, they seem to
be some new form of energy.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,250
Looks peaceful enough.
No sensor warnings. And yet...

139
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,083
It's probably just this ghoulish
setting that's making me jumpy.

140
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:57,333
Closer.
Just a little closer.

141
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,583
Good-bye, Rust Bucket!

142
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,458
Ambush! Armor up!

143
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,917
War Machine!

144
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,333
Iron Man needs us. Now, Century!

145
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:50,125
By the power of my battle staff,
I bend time and space.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,917
Fan out and find him!

147
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:09,042
I have anticipated everything,
as usual.

148
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:15,083
I have summoned the
alien dragon Fin Fang Foom!

149
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,375
Satisfactory.

150
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,417
My echo scanner
says Iron Man just took a laser hit

151
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,167
and the cyber feedback
reached his brain!

152
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,125
If we don't find him fast,
his mind will incinerate.

153
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,208
Fin Fang Foom!

154
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,625
Iron Man!

155
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:56,500
Century! Secure the perimeter
and prepare for an enemy attack!

156
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,417
We've got to get
him back to the Armory.

157
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,458
How you feeling?

158
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,333
Lousy.

159
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,500
I think I've almost
figured something out.

160
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,003
It was no problem until Fin Fang Foom

161
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,958
played Fangs for the
Memory on my cranium.

162
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,667
But none of the bad
guys were around when we showed up.

163
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,625
The Mandarin only
brings the dragon in on big deals.

164
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,625
Why would he do that
and then call him off?

165
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,167
Like, first they wanted to bust

166
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,962
your chops for checking out the sub,

167
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,958
and later they could care less.

168
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,417
Jim! "First" and "later."

169
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,875
"First" and "later" define time!

170
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,833
Something had to be happening
aboard the Prometheus.

171
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,458
When its time was up, The Mandarin
no longer had a reason to defend it!

172
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:44,250
March 11. There has to
be a link to this date. But what?

173
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,667
IRVING! I wondered
what happened to you.

174
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,125
That's it! Way to go, IRVING!

175
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,125
Now I know what this is all about!

176
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,003
If I'm right,
we haven't a minute to spare!

177
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,333
But you need rest... Later, Jim!

178
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,917
Now is the time for Iron Man!

179
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,875
And it's high noon here in London

180
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,792
as the world waits eagerly
for the opening of Hammer Tunnel.

181
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:33,833
The sequence is complete.
The world shall be mine!

182
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:36,292
This activates the sleeping
crew of the submarine.

183
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,208
Awake, my children. Awake!

184
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,292
The time has come to
serve your master. Now!

185
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,167
It took a year to
transform the Russian sailors

186
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,458
into unstoppable radioactive zombies.

187
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,292
- Serve master.
- Serve master.

188
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,375
Serve master. Serve master.

189
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,583
Serve master. Serve master.

190
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,125
The Mandarin
arranged for the sinking

191
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,792
of the Prometheus a year ago

192
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,083
and planted some sort
of bio-conversion device.

193
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,208
It extracted radical
iodine ions from sea water

194
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:16,208
and radioactively bonded them to
the normal body cells of the sailors.

195
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:19,792
It took twelve months to
transform them into zombie warriors.

196
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,125
Shouldn't you cut the ribbon?

197
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,417
Yes.

198
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,750
That would be a very good idea.

199
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,250
If The Mandarin's
zombies get loose,

200
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,003
their radioactivity
will contaminate millions,

201
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,792
and give The Mandarin a
vast slave army of the undead.

202
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,750
But that's not going to happen.

203
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,208
No! It's not possible!

204
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,375
Iron Man is here!

205
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,708
- Serve master.
- Serve master.

206
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,708
Serve master. Serve master.

207
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,917
Serve master. Serve master.

208
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,333
Serve master. Serve master.

209
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:28,542
Serve master. Serve master.

210
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:37,003
This is no way to treat a lady,
my pumpkin.

211
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,500
Especially your friend.

212
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,250
Here, that's too heavy for you.

213
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,250
I've got an idea!

214
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,042
Life support, adapt for
short-term underwater capability!

215
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,458
A year
of planning destroyed!

216
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,875
You'll pay for your bungling!

217
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,417
I haven't failed yet!

218
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,417
I've called in the most powerful
and destructive cyber-organism

219
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,708
in the universe.

220
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:24,792
Once unleashed, his ferocity
and strength are unstoppable!

221
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,917
You don't mean...

222
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,125
Not...

223
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,208
Yes!

224
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,792
Titanium Man! I thought
we finished him off at Magnitogorsk!

225
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,667
If we don't stop him...

226
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,042
We must stop him!

227
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,375
It's time to iron things out!

228
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,667
Quick! Before his
servo-stabilizers reset!

229
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,250
Nothing like asphalt
for gift-wrapping.

230
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,208
I think we better mark this
package "Do not open until Christmas

231
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,667
"in the year 3000."

232
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,250
Now!

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I guess that wraps things up.

234
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,208
One thing more.

235
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,125
The Russian sailors were innocent
victims of The Mandarin's scheme.

236
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,917
They must be redeemed.
Let their lives be as they were

237
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,792
before they served
aboard the Prometheus,

238
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,750
so justice is satisfied.

239
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:46,958
No.

240
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,917
No!

241
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,542
No!
